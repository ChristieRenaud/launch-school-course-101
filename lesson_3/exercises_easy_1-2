Question 2

! before something means the opposite. It can also signify that a method will mutate the caller if it is at the end of a method.
? at the end of a method usually returns true or false. It could also be used in the ternary operator for if...else 

1. != means does not equal and you'd use it in a conditional check
2. It would mean not user_name, returns false if user_name exists and equals anything but false or nil.
Returns true if user_name equals false or nil. Returns an error user_name doesn't exist.
3. It means that the method mutates the object.
4. I don't know.
5. After a method it returns true or false.
6. !! before something means two nots. Returns true if something is truthy and false if it is false. Turns an object into its boolean equivalent (true or false)
